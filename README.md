HTML & CSS: Layout Reading
==========================

One of the best CSS tutorials out there is from a local web development shop, [bocoup](https://bocoup.com). Their [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com) tutorial focuses on fundamentals of CSS, something we want to focus on early to improve our development speed and understanding of CSS for later projects.

The tutorial is made of short sections that focus on one, specific aspect of layout with CSS. This makes it not only a great tutorial for layout, but also a valuable reference for later. You'll probably come back to this document from time to time when you need help with your layout.

Instructions
------------

1. Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com). This should take about 45 minutes to an hour.
1. File an issue on this repository with a response to the following questions:
    * What is the different options for `box-sizing`? Explain the differences between them.
    * In your own words, explain the difference between relative and absolute positioning.
    * What are three "gotchas" when working with CSS layouts? "Gotchas" are common mistakes that are easy to make, even if you know better.
